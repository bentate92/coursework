1)  The graph is stored as a list of vertices and which other vertices
    they share edges with.

2)  Graphs 2 and 3 are connected, as evidenced by the fact that every
    pair of vertices in their output shows a path exists.

3)  If the DFSs and BFSs were reversed, there would be no change in the
    output. However, if the edges were directed, it very well could.
    For example, in graph 1, vertex 8 only shares an edge with vertex 2.
    If that edge was directed from 2 to 8, then 8 would of course be 
    reachable from 2, but 2 would not be reachable from 8.

4)  The main difference between the two is the order in which they
    traverse a graph. Breadth first-spreads out, while depth-first moves
    in a line. Because of this, BFS might be faster if the destination 
    vertex is somewhere near the source, but DFS would be faster if 
    the destination was very deep into the maze. Advantages and disad-
    vantages of each are of course dependent on the shape of the graph
    as well, though. For example, on a very wide graph, a BFS might use
    too much memory, and on a graph that is more or less a straight
    line, there might be no difference at all.

5)  The Big O execution time for DFS and BFS is, on average, O(n), 
    where n is the number of edges in the graph.
