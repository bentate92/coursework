1)  The words 'ate' and 'eat' would produce identical values using hashFunction1(), as
    61+74+65 = 65+61+74 = 200, but would produce different values using hashFunction2().
    With hashFunction2(), 'ate' would be calculated as (1*61)+(2*74)+(3*65) = 404, while
    'eat' would be (1*65)+(2*61)+(3*74) = 409.

2)  Because hashFunction1() will store those words in the same bucket, so with a file like
    input3.txt, searches will be much less efficient (O(n) instead of O(1)).

3)  No, because the same words will still be in the HashMap, just in different places.

4)  No, because both size and capacity would remain the same, and since load is the ratio of 
    the two, it will be the same as well.

5)  Yes, because the words will be loaded into different buckets. To use input3.txt as an 
    example again, hashFunction1() would cause there to be 9 empty buckets (as all three words
    would be in the same bucket), while hashFunction2() would make only 7 empty buckets (as
    all three words would be in their own buckets).

6)  Yes, because there are less total buckets, so if no bucket had more than one link
    to begin with, and some had no links in them, there would be fewer empty buckets.
